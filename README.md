## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model that classifies breast tumors as benign or malignant. By analyzing medical features from biopsy data, this tool serves as a diagnostic support system for healthcare professionals. The goal is to enhance cancer detection accuracy and improve patient care through AI-driven tumor classification.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Breast Cancer Prediction model, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/F4he23/Brest-Cancer-Prediction/releases). This release includes all necessary files and instructions for running the model.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project consists of various medical features extracted from biopsy data. Each entry in the dataset includes:

- Tumor size
- Cell shape
- Cell margin
- Cell nucleus characteristics
- And more...

These features help in determining whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

### Example Data Entry

| Feature          | Value   |
|------------------|---------|
| Tumor Size       | 15     |
| Cell Shape       | 1      |
| Cell Margin      | 0      |
| Nucleus Size     | 1      |

## Modeling Techniques

This project employs various machine learning algorithms to classify tumors:

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification.
- **Naive Bayes**: A simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees.
- **Support Vector Machines**: A powerful algorithm for classification tasks.
- **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting library.

Each model contributes to the overall prediction accuracy and provides insights into the data.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the models, we use several evaluation metrics:

- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive results to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive results to the total actual positives.
- **ROC Curve**: A graphical representation of the true positive rate against the false positive rate.

These metrics help in understanding how well the models perform in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/F4he23/Brest-Cancer-Prediction.git
cd Brest-Cancer-Prediction
```

Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the model by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will load the dataset, train the models, and output the evaluation metrics. For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation included in the repository.

### Example Command

To run the model with a specific algorithm, you can specify it as an argument:

```bash
python main.py --algorithm random_forest
```
